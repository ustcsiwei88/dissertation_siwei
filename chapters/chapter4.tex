\chapter{Separating Polygonal Sets with Minimum Sets of Lines}
\thispagestyle{myheadings}

After two chapters' discussion on covering perimeters or regions, which is essentially separating 
some critical polygonal regions from the outside workspace. 
This chapter digs deeper into this problem by studying the separation of more than two regions. 
To simplify the problem, a line-of-sight sensing model will be adopted, where each sensor can cover
an unobstructed line segment like a laser beam. Also, the regions are assumed to be polygonal.

The objective in this case is to minimize the number of sensors used to separate these polygonal sets 
at the existence of obstacles.
% The main objective here is to minimize the number of sensor used.
The problem is NP-hard even for the problem of separating two sets of regions with the minimum number of lines. 
Still, integer programming can provide a near-optimal solution for around 20 objects in a reasonable amount of time.
