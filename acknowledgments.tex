First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge to my advisor Prof. Jingjin Yu, 
who is also the lab director of the Algorithmic Robotics and Control Lab (ARCL). 
He has been extremely helpful during my PhD journey 
not only in guiding me into research, funding my study and helping me through academic challenges, 
but also in providing professional advice during my low time in the last year. 
It's really my great pleasure and fortune to work on algorithmic robotics 
as well as many fun projects with JJ! 

I also want to express my sincere appreciation to my committee members. 
Prof. Kostas E. Bekris was the lecturer of the first two robotics classes I fortunately took in the first year: 
computational robotics and robot manipulation seminar, both of which guided me 
towards a more mature and experienced roboticist. 
Prof. Abdeslam Boularias's kindness and amicability as well as his positive working attitude affects
the atmosphere of the whole robotics lab.

Thanks to my labmates at ARCL who are also my collaborators: Shuai Han, 
Kai Gao, Teng Guo, Baichuan Huang, Wei Tang, Sijie Ding, Andy Xu, Tanay Punjabi, 
Justin Yu, and Xinyu Cai. 

PhD is not easy, were it not for my friends, my PhD life 
could not have been as wonderful as it has been so far. 
So, I want to thank them here: Rui Wang, Junchi Liang, Chaitanya Mitash, Bowen Wen, Juntao Tan, 
Isidoros Marougkas, Jonathan Garcia-Mullen, Shiyang Lu, Yinglong Miao, Haonan Chang, Xinyu Zhang, 
Dhruv Metha Ramesh, Alon Flor, and Hansen Lim. 

I would like to thank Nokia Bell Labs for the summer internship opportunity,
and my mentor Dr. Fangzhe Chang for his instructions.

The pandemic happens to be between the 2nd and the 4th year of my PhD journey, 
and it entirely changed people's life and working style. 
But luckily we are back to normal, I think specially thanks should be given to the 
selfless medical workers who helped us fight the virus. 

Last but not least, I need to say thanks to my parents for their unconditional love 
and caring throughout these years of my life.
