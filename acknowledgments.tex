Firstly, I would like to acknowledge to my boss Prof. Jingjin Yu, 
who is also the lab director of the Algorithmic Robotics and Control Lab (ARCL). 
He has been extremely helpful during my PhD journey 
not only in guiding me into research, funding my study and helping me through academic challenges, 
but also in providing professional advice during my stress and depression period in my last year. 
It's really my great pleasure and fortune to work on algorithmic robotics 
as well as many fun projects with JJ! 

I also want to express my sincere appreciation to my committee members. 
Prof. Kostas E. Bekris was the lecturer of the first two robotics classes I took: 
computational robotics and robot manipulation seminar, both of which guide me 
towards a more mature and experienced roboticist. 

I also want to thank my labmates at ARCL who are also my collaborators Shuai Han, 
Kai Gao, Teng Guo, Baichuan Huang, Wei Tang, Sijie Ding, Andy Xu, Tanay Punjabi, 
Justin Yu, and Xinyu Cai. 

PhD is not easy, were it not for my friends, my PhD life 
could not have been as wonderful as it has been so far. 
So, I want to thank them here: Rui Wang, Junchi Liang, Bowen Wen, Juntao Tan, Chaitanya Mitash, 
Isidoros Marougkas, Shiyang Lu, Yinglong Miao, Haonan Chang, Xinyu Zhang, 
Dhruv Metha Ramesh, Alon Flor, and Hansen Lim. 

The pandemic period happens to be in the 2nd to the 4th year of my PhD journey and it entirely changed people's 
life and working style. But luckily we are back to normal, I think specially thanks should be given to the 
selflessly medical workers who helped us fight with the virus. 

Last but not least, I need to say thanks to my parents for their unconditional love 
and caring throughout these years of my life.
