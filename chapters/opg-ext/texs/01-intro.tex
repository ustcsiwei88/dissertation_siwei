Consider the scenario where many mobile guards (or sensors) are to be deployed 
to patrol 
the perimeter of some 2D regions (Fig.~\ref{fig:ex}) against intrusion, where 
each guard may effectively cover a continuous segment of a region's boundary. 
When part of a boundary need not be secured, e.g., there may already be 
some existing barriers (the blue segments in Fig.~\ref{fig:ex}), optimally 
distributing the robots so that each robot's coverage is minimized becomes 
an interesting and non-trivial computational task \cite{FenHanGaoYu19RSS}. 
It is established \cite{FenHanGaoYu19RSS} that, when the guards have 
the same capabilities, the problem, called the {\em optimal perimeter guarding} 
(\opg), resides in the complexity class P (polynomial time class), 
even when the robots must be distributed across many different boundaries.

regions must be secured. Zooming in on part of the boundary of one 
of the regions (the part inside the small circle), portions of the 
boundary (the red segments) must be guarded while the rest (the 
blue dotted segments) does not need guarding. For example, the zoomed-in 
part of the boundary may be monitored by two mobile robots, each patrolling
along one of the green segments.}

In this work, we investigate a significantly more general version of \opg 
where the mobile guards may be heterogeneous. More specifically, two 
formulations with different guarding/sensing models are addressed in our 
study. 
%
In the first, the number of available robots is fixed where robots of 
different types have a fixed ratio of capability (e.g., one type of 
robot may be able to run faster or may have better sensor). The guarding task 
must be evenly divided among the robots so that each robot, regardless of 
type, will not need to bear a too large coverage/capability ratio. This 
formulation is denoted as {\em optimal perimeter guarding with limited 
resources} or \opglr.
%
In the second, the number of robots is unlimited; instead, for each type, 
the sensing range is fixed with a fixed associated cost. The goal here is 
to find a deployment plan so as to fully cover the perimeter while minimizing 
the total cost. We call this the {\em optimal perimeter guarding with 
minimum cost} problem, or \opgmc. 

Unlike the plain vanilla version of the \opg problem, we establish that both 
\opglr and \opgmc are NP-hard when the number of robot types is part of the 
problem input. They are, however, at different hardness levels. \opglr is shown 
to be NP-hard in the strong sense, thus reducing the likelihood of finding a fully
polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).
% solutions to even approximately solving it to arbitrary precision. 
Nevertheless, for the more practical case where the number of robot types 
is a constant, we show that \opglr can be solved using a pseudo-polynomial 
time algorithm with reasonable scalability. On the other hand, we show that 
\opgmc is weakly NP-hard through the establishment of a pseudo-polynomial 
time algorithm for \opgmc with arbitrary number of robot types. 
We further show that, when the number of robot types is fixed, \opgmc can be 
solved in polynomial time through a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) approach.
This paragraph also summarizes the main contributions of this work. 

A main motivation behind our study of the \opg formulations is to address 
a key missing element in executing autonomous, scalable, and optimal robot 
deployment tasks. Whereas much research has been devoted to multi-robot 
motion planning \cite{ErdLoz86,arai2002advances} with great success, e.g., 
\cite{blm-rvo,smith2009monotonic,ayanian2010decentralized,turpin2014capt,
alonso2015multi,SolYu15}, existing results in the robotics literature appear 
to generally assume that a target robot distribution is already provided; the 
problem of how to effectively generate optimal deployment patterns is largely 
left unaddressed. It should be noted that control-based solutions to the 
multi-agent deployment problem do exist, e.g.,\cite{ando1999distributed,
jadbabaie2003coordination,cortes2004coverage,ren2005consensus,
schwager2009optimal,yu2012rendezvous,morgan2016swarm}, but the final solutions 
are obtained through many local iterations and generally do not come with 
global optimality guarantees. For example, in \cite{cortes2004coverage}, 
Voronoi-based iterative methods compute locally optimal target formations 
for various useful tasks. In contrast, this work, as well as 
\cite{FenHanGaoYu19RSS}, targets the scalable computation of globally optimal 
solutions.

As a coverage problem, \opg may be characterized as a 1D version 
of the well-studied Art Gallery problems  \cite{o1987art,shermer1992recent},
which commonly assume a sensing model based on line-of-sight 
visibility\cite{lozano1979algorithm}; the goal is to ensure that every point
in the  interior of a given region is visible to at least one of the deployed 
guards. Depending on the exact formulation, guards may be placed on 
boundaries, corners, or the interior of the region. Not surprisingly, Art
Gallery problems are typically NP-hard \cite{lee1986computational}. Other
than Art Gallery, 2D coverage problems with other sensing models, e.g., 
disc-based, have also been considered \cite{thue1910dichteste,hales2005proof,
drezner1995facility,cortes2004coverage,pavone2009equitable
,pierson2017adapting}, where some formulations prevent the overlapping 
of individual sensing ranges \cite{thue1910dichteste,hales2005proof} while 
others seek to ensure a full coverage which often requires intersection
of sensor ranges. 
%
In viewing of these studies, this study helps painting a broader landscape 
of sensor coverage research.

In terms of structural resemblance, \opglr and \opgmc share many similarities 
with {\em bin packing}  \cite{johnson1973near} and other related problems. 
In a bin packing problem, objects are to be selected to fit within bins of 
given sizes. Viewing the segments (the red ones in Fig.~\ref{fig:ex}) as 
bins, \opg seeks to place guards so that the segments are fully contained in 
the union of the guards' joint coverage span. In this regard, \opg is a dual
problem to bin packing since the former must overfill the bins and the later 
cannot fully fill the bins. In the extreme, however, both bin packing and 
\opg converge to a \subsetsum \cite{karp1972reducibility} like problem where 
one seeks to partition objects into halves of equal total sizes, i.e., the 
objects should fit exactly within the bins. With an additional cost term, 
\opgmc has further similarities with the \ttkp problem \cite{ukphardness}, 
which is weakly NP-hard \cite{dantzig1957discrete}.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:opgext-problem},
mathematical formulations of the two \opg variants are fully specified. In
Section~\ref{sec:opgext-hardness}, both \opglr and \opgmc are shown to be 
NP-hard. Despite the hardness hurdles, in Section~\ref{sec:opgext-algorithm}, 
multiple algorithms are derived for \opglr and \opgmc, including effective
implementable solutions for both. In Section~\ref{sec:opgext-application},
we perform numerical evaluation of selected algorithms and demonstrate 
how they may be applied to address multi-robot deployment problems. We 
discuss and conclude our study in Section~\ref{sec:opgext-conclusion}. Please
