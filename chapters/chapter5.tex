\thispagestyle{myheadings}

This chapter deals with the dynamic setting for mobile sensing robots, 
and two different but related problems are studied. 
The first problem is the boundary defense problem in the context of heterogeneous defenders first studied in \cite{adler2022role}.
It can be seen as an extension of the perimeter defense problem \cite{shishika2020review}. 
In this problem, there are $k$ sensing robots moving on top of a perimeter with different speeds $v_1,\dots,v_k$.
A sequence of attacks $\langle loc_i, t_i \rangle_{i=1}^{n}$ are given at different time stamps and at different locations.
The objective is to intercept as many attacks as possible.
The second problem is the coordinated sweeping problem where a group of robots coordinate to sweep a region 
with obstacles. Each robot possesses a given sensing capability, and the sweeping trajectory is 
given beforehand. The objective of it is to minimize the number of robots used such that the sweeping plan 
can be executed and every point in the workspace is sensed with a certain required quality.
