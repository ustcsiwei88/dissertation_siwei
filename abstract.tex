Robots or robotic applications, like living beings, perceive the world through
a great varieties of sensors: cameras, range sensors, lidar, radar, laser beams and so on.
For range sensors, be it acoustic like sonar, photic like cameras, laser beams or lidars, 
the sensing range can, to some extent, be ideally abstracted as either 1D lines or 2D circles.
Hence, it would be helpful to study the properties of the underlying geometric problems including 
how to deploy line-of-sight sensors to guard the perimeter of some region such that intruders cannot penetrate through, 
how to arrange barriers so that different sets of regions can be separated from each other,
how to set up a sensor network with mobile range sensors to fully cover a region. 

The main body of this dissertation is divided into five parts, each of them comes with relevant publications. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perimeter guarding with homogeneous or heterogeneous 1D line-of-sight sensors
    \item Covering the boundary or the interior of a polygon with range sensors
    \item Separating polygonal sets with the minimum number of barriers
    \item Dynamic sweep line coverage % and perimeter defense
    \item Relevant applications
\end{itemize}
