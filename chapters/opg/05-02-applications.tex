\noindent\textbf{Securing a perimeter}. As a first application, consider
a situation where a crime has just been committed at the Edinburgh 
Castle (see ~\ref{fig:opg-edinburgh}). The culprit remains in the confines 
of the castle but is mixed within many guests at the scene. As the 
situation is being investigated and suppose that the brick colored 
buildings are secured, guards (either personnel or a number of drones) may 
be deployed to ensure the culprit does not escape by climbing down the 
castle walls. Using \algoSRG, a deployment plan can be quickly computed 
given the amount of resources at hand so that each guard only needs to 
secure a minimum length along the castle walls. ~\ref{fig:opg-edinburgh} 
shows the optimal deployment plan for $15$ guards.

	that create gaps along the boundary.}

\noindent\textbf{Fire monitoring}. In a second application, consider 
~\ref{fig:opg-forest} where a forest fire has just been put out in 
multiple regions. As there is still some chance that the fire may 
rekindle and spread, for prevention, a team of firefighters is to be 
deployed to watch for the possible spreading of the fire. Here, in 
addition to using \algoMRG to compute optimal locations for deploying 
the firefighters, we also generate minimum time trajectories for the 
firefighters to reach their target locations while avoiding going 
through the dangerous forests. This is done via solving a bottleneck 
assignment problem \cite{burkard1999linear}.
Note that the lake region creates gaps that cannot be traveled by the 
firefighters; this can be handled by making these gaps infinitely large. 
~\ref{fig:opg-forest} shows the optimal locations for $34$ firefighters. 
Animations of the deployment process and other test cases can be found 
in the accompanying video.
