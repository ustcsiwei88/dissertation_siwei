First and foremost, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor Prof. Jingjin Yu, 
who is also the lab director of the Algorithmic Robotics and Control Lab (ARCL). 
He has been extremely helpful during my PhD journey 
not only in guiding me into robotics research, funding my study and helping me through academic challenges,
but also in providing personal and professional advice during my stress and depression period. 
It's really my great pleasure and fortune to work on algorithmic robotics 
as well as many fun projects with you! 

I also want to express my sincere appreciation to my committee members. 
Prof. Kostas E. Bekris was the intructor of the first two robotics classes I have taken: 
Computational Robotics and Robot Manipulation seminar, both of which guild me 
towards a mature roboticist. 

I also want to thank my labmates at ARCL who are also my collaborators Shuai Han, 
Kai Gao, Teng Guo, Baichuan Huang, Wei Tang, Sijie Ding, Andy Xu, Tanay Punjabi, 
Justin Yu, and Xinyu Cai.

PhD is not easy, were it not for my friends, my PhD life
could not have been so wonderful. 
So, I want to thank them here: Junchi Liang, Bowen Wen, Rui Wang, Juntao Tan, Chaitanya Mitash, 
Isidoros Marougkas, Shiyang Lu, Yinglong Miao, Haonan Chang, Xinyu Zhang, 
Dhruv Metha Ramesh, Alon Flor, and Hansen Lim.
