First and foremost, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor Prof. Jingjin Yu. 
He has been extremely helpful during my PhD journey 
not only in funding my study and helping me with academic challenges,
but also in providing advice during my stress and depression period. 
It's really my great pleasure and fortune to work on algorithmic robotics 
as well as other realworld projects with you!


I also want to express my sincere appreciation to my committee members. 
Prof. Bekris was the intructor of the first two robotics classes I have taken: 
Computational Robotics and Robot Manipulation seminar both of which guilds me toward a mature roboticist.

I also want to thank my labmates who are also my collaborators Shuai Han, 
Kai Gao, Teng Guo, Baichuan Huang, Wei Tang, Justin Yu, Andy Xu and Xinyu Cai. 

PhD is not easy, especially for
