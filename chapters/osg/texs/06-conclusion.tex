In this study, we examine \osgt, the problem of directly computing a deployment 
strategy for covering 1D or 2D critical sets using many mobile sensors while 
minimizing the maximum sensing radius. After showing that \osgt is computationally 
intractable to even approximate within $1.152$, we describe several 
algorithmic solutions with optimality and/or computation time guarantees. 
Subsequent thorough evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of these algorithmic 
solutions. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our algorithmic solutions with 
two application scenarios.

Due to space limit, guarding perimeters with gaps (see, e.g.,~\cite{FenHanGaoYuRSS19}) 
is not discussed in this work. However, because our algorithms work with a 
grid-based discretization, the results directly apply to arbitrary bounded 1D and 2D 
sets. 

Many intriguing questions follow; we mention two here concerning the sensing 
capabilities. First, \osgt works with circular regions which is perhaps the simplest one
due to symmetry. What if the sensor region is not circular? Whereas such cases 
appear to be hard \cite{culberson1988covering}, effective scalable solutions may 
still be possible. Secondly, currently we assume that all parts of the critical 
set to be guarded have equal importance. What if certain subsets are more important?
