For each of Problems~\ref{p:surf-1}-\ref{p:surf-3}, extensive experimental evaluations were carried out to evaluate our proposed algorithmic solutions. Here, we present representative evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods, with a focus on three realistic settings (the ICU model from ~\ref{fig:surf-ex}, bus and subway car models shown in ~\ref{fig:surf-bus-subway}). %
For all environments, the surface $S$ is selected to be all visible surfaces not facing downward.
Due to limited space, result on the (2+$\varepsilon$)-approximation algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{alg:surf-greedy}) is omitted (as shown in \cite{fengyu2020optimally}, such methods are fast but are quite sub-optimal). The experiments were carried out on a median-end quad-core Intel i7 processor with 16GiB RAM. 
Algorithms were implemented in C++. Gurobi \cite{optimization2019gurobi} was used as the Integer Programming solver.

\end{figure}

Results on Problem~\ref{p:surf-1}, using ILP, is given in ~\ref{fig:surf-coverage-ratio-vis}. 
For each model, $600$ candidate sensor locations and $20,000$ coverage surface points are sampled using grids. 
As expected, the surface coverage ratios increase as the number of sensors increase, approaching full coverage. We note that certain surface region is not visible, e.g., ground underneath seats in subway cars, leading to plateaus below $100\%$ coverage. The computation time is very reasonable for offline computations. The spikes in the middle of the computation time plot correspond to hard cases when the visibility coverage is about to plateau. We also observe that subway $<$ ICU $<$ bus in terms 
of computation time, which may be explained by the interior complexity of these environments. This aspect is different across the three problems.

In evaluating Problem~\ref{p:surf-2}, we first examine a case where mobile sensors
(e.g., camera drones) are deployed to cover a synthetic terrain with relatively 
small curvature, i.e., $vis(\cdot, \cdot) \equiv 1$. An illustration of the 
setting is given in the figure on the right, where the color indicates the height 
of the terrain. The sensors (8 red triangles in the figure) are placed
at a fixed height above the terrain and must guard the region enclosed 
in the black curve. Spherical range sensing is assumed. For the setup 
($600$ sensor locations and $20,000$ surface points), computation time 
and solution quality as the number of sensors changes are listed in the table. 
Computation time decreases as the number of sensors 
increases, indicating the problem is harder when sensors are too few to provide 
a good coverage. It also shows that the ILP running time does not depend positively
on sensor quantity. The quality (smaller is better) increase becomes minimal
as sensor quantity reaches $10$.

In a second evaluation of Problem~\ref{p:surf-2}, visibility is considered with the 
optimization coverage ratio set to $80\%$. That is, at least $80\%$ of the
maximum visible target surface (for a given $k$) will be guaranteed the achieved coverage 
quality. The result, summarized in ~\ref{fig:surf-coverage-ratio-mq}, again 
demonstrates a negative correlation between the computational time and the number 
of sensors. Here, however, the computational time is $20+$ times  more 
than when having full visibility.

\end{figure}

Our last benchmark on Problem~\ref{p:surf-2} tests the effectiveness of the local improvement following the resolution of a coarsely generated ILP, at $60$ candidate sensor locations and $1000$ surface samples (~\ref{fig:surf-coverage-ratio-cu}). The right figure shows much faster computation time. The left figure shows that the  faster method does a decent job for the bus environment (other environments have similar outcomes). The result suggests which method to use would depend on whether computational time or solution optimality is more important to the task at hand. We note that the local improvement method does not help improve the ILP result at the higher resolution.

    [right] Computation time using coarse ILP + local improvement.}
\label{fig:surf-coverage-ratio-cu}
\end{figure}

For Problem~\ref{p:surf-3}, computation becomes more demanding. At the specified 
discretization level, most ILP models did not complete the optimization process 
in $10$ minutes. The intermediate quality result is given in ~\ref{fig:surf-computation-time-3}, on the left (the same threshold, selected to make the computation challenging, is used for all three environments), where the lines 
corresponds to the coverage ratio returned by the ILP model and the attached vertical bars show the reported optimality gap. The crosses show the updated ratio after local improvement is carried out (the triangles will be explained shortly). 
The subway data was shifted to the left to improve readability.
For the bus, we see that the local improvement does help improve solution optimality, suggesting it is the most difficult problem. For the other two, it appears that the solution by the ILP model is already quite optimal, but the ILP solver still needs time to close the gap from the above. The subway case has worse coverage by the same number of sensors because it is larger. If we run a coarse ILP model ($60$ sensor candidates, $1000$ surface sample) for one minute and then do local improvement, we get coverage ratios shown as the triangles in ~\ref{fig:surf-computation-time-3}, left. ~\ref{fig:surf-computation-time-3}, right shows the total computation time used. We observe that except for the challenging bus model, the faster method achieves essentially identical optimality as running ILP at higher resolutions. Subway costs most time here because it is the largest.

% For the last evaluation of Problem~\ref{p:3}, 

Lastly, we provide some additional visualization to help further demonstrate the structure of the problems. ~\ref{fig:surf-icu-comp} shows that Problems~\ref{p:surf-2} and~\ref{p:surf-3} induce different optimal distribution of sensors. Generally, Problems~\ref{p:surf-2} tends to cause the sensors to be evenly spaced out. On the other hand, Problem~\ref{p:surf-3} tends to balance between spacing out sensors and provide good cumulative coverage, which may require sensors to aggregate, which can be observed in ~\ref{fig:surf-bus}.
