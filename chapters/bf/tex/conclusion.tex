In this work, we have formulated a barrier forming problem with three
different variants, separating point sets, separating point sets with polygonal obstacles, and separating polygonal object sets with polygonal obstacles, for which we seek a solution containing the minimum number of straight line segment separators. 
We provided structural analysis for this NP-hard problem and describe
a novel barrier candidate proposal and filtering algorithm, which is optimal for the first two variants and at least 2-OPT for the third.

The method can effectively work with tens of objects including obstacles, as is illustrated in our four sets of experiments conducted.

Nevertheless, finding more scalable algorithm to this problem, as well as solving barrier forming for polygons optimally, are of great interest.
The exploration of dynamic barrier forming with moving barriers is also an important direction to pursue.
