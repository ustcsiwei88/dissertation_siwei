\subsection{Optimal Robot Allocation}

% \newcommand{\bdag}{{\textsc DAG}}

Our proposed algorithm can be divided into two steps at the high level. 
In the first step, the algorithm conducts a \emph{generalized boustrophedon 
decomposition} for the given environment along the sweep line, 
which generates a \textit{directed acyclic graph} (DAG) representation 
of the workspace $\mathcal W$ for a given sweep schedule. 
Using the DAG, a max-flow-based algorithm is then applied to compute the 
minimum number of robots required for executing the sweep schedule, 
as well as the corresponding arrangement of robots.

\subsection{Generalized Boustrophedon Decomposition}
In solving search and coverage problems, various decomposition techniques 
have been proposed, including trapezoidal, Voronoi, boustrophedon, Morse decompositions, 
and so on \cite{huang2001optimal, choset2000coverage, breitenmoser2010voronoi, acar2002morse}.
For our robot allocation task, it is also natural to start with a decomposition 
of the environment. 
However, we need a decomposition supporting non-straight 
boundaries between the decomposed cells, created by the sweep schedule. 
For this, we propose a generalization of boustrophedon decomposition. 

Before describing the generalization of boustrophedon decomposition, 
we briefly introduce boustrophedon decomposition (readers are referred to 
\cite{choset2000coverage} for further details), which in turn is based on 
trapezoidal decomposition. The difference is that it removes the sweeping 
events that cross inner vertices. As illustrated in ~\ref{fig:sc-trebou},
compared with trapezoidal decomposition, boustrophedon decomposition 
has fewer cells, which leads to fewer (back-and-forth) boustrophedon motions.

We extend the boustrophedon decomposition from using only vertical sweep lines 
to allow the use of any \emph{continuous monotone sweep schedule}.
We are given a sweep schedule $P(t)$ for a workspace $\mathcal W$, 
which could take any curved form (see ~\ref{fig:sc-Bou}).
By following the sweep schedule, it is possible to
construct a decomposition of $\mathcal W$, based on the events of cell
splitting and merging.

\begin{theorem}
A sweep schedule can be organized in a DAG by the generalized boustrophedon decomposition.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Following the sweep schedule, we can conduct a generalized boustrophedon 
decomposition of the workspace $\mathcal W$. 
%
A node in the DAG will represent a cell after the decomposition, whose 
parents and children are the predecessor and successor cells along the 
sweep schedule. 

Additionally, we add a source node that links to all nodes without a parent 
and add a terminal node that links from all nodes without a child.
%
Since obstacles in the environment can contain concave vertices, we must 
consider two special cases involving concave vertices for the construction of DAG, 
as illustrated in ~\ref{fig:sc-concave_vertices}. 
%
When a line segment of the sweep schedule ends at a concave vertex, 
the corresponding node in the DAG is linked to the terminal node $t$.
When a line segment of the sweep schedule starts at a concave vertex,
the corresponding node in the DAG is linked from the source node $s$.
In mapping these scenarios to detailed plans, it means that 
some robots will start later or end earlier compared with 
others.

% \begin{remark}



The implementation of the generalized boustrophedon decomposition is similar 
to vertical decomposition, we provide here an implementation 
Alg.~\ref{alg:genbou} adapted from \cite{lavalle2006sweepline} under the 
\emph{generation position} assumption (i.e., there are no degenerative 
settings).
%
Basically, the algorithm works by maintaining a binary search tree for 
\emph{boundary chains} representing cell boundaries. The algorithm considers 
two types of events during the sweeping process: splitting a cell into two 
cells and merging two cells into one cell.
%
Since the time cost mainly comes from maintaining the binary search tree of 
chains, with an efficient implementation, Alg.~\ref{alg:genbou} requires 
$O(n \log n)$ time, where $n$ is the complexity of the environment. 


\subsection{Reduction to Circulation with Demand}
Since we are working with \emph{monotone sweep schedules}, for any point $p$ in 
$\mathcal W$, it can only be contained in $P(t')$ for a single $t'$, i.e., each 
point $p \in \mathcal W$ is only swept once. 
%
Denote the length of the line segment where it is contained as $L$, which 
requires at least $\zeta(L)$ robots inside that segment at time $t'$
(recall that $\zeta$ is the primitive defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:sc-sensing}).
%
For each decomposed cell, the minimum number of robots required is $\zeta(\ell_{max})$, where $\ell_{max}$ 
is the maximum length of the sweep line inside that cell.
%
Given a DAG $G(V,E)$ that represents the sweep schedule, the arrangement problem of the robots along the sweep line can be transformed into a network 
flow problem on the DAG.
%
For each node $v\in G$, there is a requirement of coverage for the node, 
$demand(v)$, which can be computed as $\zeta(v.\ell_{max})$.
%
Given the DAG and the demands, we are then to ``flow'' the robots through 
the schedule, allocating a certain number of robots to each decomposed cell 
along the way to satisfy these demands. 
%

Specifically, our problem may be further cast as a \emph{circulation with demand} 
problem \cite{kleinberg2006algorithm}, with the following augmentation. We replace 
each node $v$ in $G$ with two vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ and replace every edge 
$uv$ in the previous graph with edge $u_2 v_1$, as illustrated in ~\ref{fig:sc-flow}. 
The edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$ has flow demand of $demand(v)$. 
The following minimum circulation with demand problem is then obtained.

\subsection{The Complete Allocation Algorithm}
The overall algorithm for robot allocation is described as in Alg.~\ref{alg:sc-overall}.
To analyze the running time of Alg.~\ref{alg:sc-overall} for a polygonal environment, 
we denote the environment complexity (number of vertices) as $n$. 
As mentioned in the previous section, the generalized boustrophedon decomposition takes $O(n\log n)$ time. 
As the generation of a node in the DAG comes from some chain insertion or deletion events, and an event would require one vertex to happen, 
there is at most $O(n)$ decomposed cells, i.e., nodes in the DAG. 
Similarly, adding edges between nodes comes from some chain insertion or deletion events, and the number of events is at most $O(n)$. 
So, both the number of edges and the number of nodes in the DAG is $O(n)$.
Moreover, it is easy to see that the DAG is a planar graph since a node corresponds to a decomposed cell, and there is an edge between nodes only if the two corresponding cells are adjacent.
The circulation with demand problem requires solving two max-flow problems based on the DAG. 
If we use the push-relabel algorithm \cite{cheriyan1989analysis} that runs in $O(V^2\sqrt{E})$, solving the max flow for this problem will cost $O(n^{2.5})$, 
% If we use the Dinic's algorithm \cite{dinitz1970algorithm} that runs in $O(V^2E)$, solving the max flow for this problem will cost $O(n^{3})$, 
since $|V|, |E| = O(n)$.% for planar graphs.

\begin{remark}
In the case of having a fixed number of robots, 
and the objective is to 
maximize the minimum coverage probability of a point in $\mathcal W$.
We can apply binary search on the minimum coverage probability we can guarantee, 
where Alg.~\ref{alg:sc-overall} can be used to decide whether some coverage probability can be guaranteed by 
the fixed number of robots.
% The algorithm is detailed out in Alg.~\ref{alg:fixednum}
%\r{I think a remark is enough to say it}
