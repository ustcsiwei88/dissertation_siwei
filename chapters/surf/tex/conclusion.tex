We have formulated a general Sensor Placement for Optimal Coverage (\spoc) problem with three concrete instantiations, each with distinct practical applications. We provide near-optimal methods for solving these challenging optimization problems and demonstrated their effectiveness with extensive evaluations. We are currently exploring real-world applications of our methods.
